# GitCheat
This is a very basic, only to be referenced python3 script which one can use to increase their follower count on github.

The script basically combines Telethon to use the FakeMailBot on Telegram in order to generate fake mails in successions, then uses those to sign up for new Github accounts using Selenium.

The whole process is mostly automated, you only need to complete the verification part on the Github sign up page.

NOTE : I only really made this script as a joke, but it turned out to have serious complications. I increased my followers from 39 to 104 and a day later, GitHub flagged my account and I was basically off the website (publicly) for almost a month.

``DO NOT USE THIS. I SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES WHICH MIGHT HAPPEN DUE TO THIS SCRIPT.``
